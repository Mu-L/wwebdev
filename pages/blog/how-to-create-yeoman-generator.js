        <p>
            I found myself often copy-pasting code from other projects when starting new projects.
            This is why I created a Yeoman generator, which setups
            a <a href="https://github.com/Vincenius/generator-next-styled-components" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nextjs project with styled components</a>,
            as this is one of my most commonly used base structures.
        </p>
        <img src="/blog/yeoman/demo.gif" alt="yeoman generator demonstration" />

        <h2>Creating your own generator</h2>
        <p>
            In this post I'll explain how Yeoman works and how you can set up your own generator.
            First of all you'll have to globally install <a href="https://yeoman.io/" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yeoman </a> and
            the <a href="https://github.com/yeoman/generator-generator" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">generator-generator</a> from
            Yeoman, which helps setting up new generators.
        </p>
        <CodeBlock value="npm install -g yo generator-generator" />
        <p>
            After the installation is done, you can scaffold your generator by typing <ui.Code>yo generator</ui.Code> and
            going through the wizard. Now the structure of your project should look like this:
        </p>
        <ui.SmallImage src="/blog/yeoman/structure.png" alt="yeoman generator structure" />
        <p>
            To be able to test your generator locally, you'll have to symlink a
            global module to your local file by going into your generated directory and typing:
        </p>
        <CodeBlock value="npm link" />
        <p>
            Now you'll be able to run your generator by typing <ui.Code>yo name-of-your-generator</ui.Code>.
            I'd recommend opening a new workspace for that, so you're not messing up your generator project.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you do that right away you'll get an error, if you don't have bower installed. That's because yeoman is trying to install
            dependencies with npm and bower by default. But don't worry, we'll cover this later.
        </p>
        <p>
            The interesting part of the generator is happening inside <ui.Code>generators/app/</ui.Code>.
            Let's have a look at the <ui.Code>index.js</ui.Code> in the app folder first. The exported class
            includes three functions: <ui.Code>prompting()</ui.Code>, <ui.Code>writing()</ui.Code> and <ui.Code>install()</ui.Code>
        </p>

        <h3>prompting()</h3>

        <p>
            This function is executed first when running your generator.
        </p>

        <CodeBlock
            language="javascript"
            value={snippet1}
        />

        <p>
            In the beginning, the function greets the user with <ui.Code>this.log()</ui.Code>. Afterward, the
            questions for the user of the generator are defined in the constant <ui.Code>prompts</ui.Code>.
            In the end, the answers to these prompts are stored in <ui.Code>this.props</ui.Code> by their name. So the answer
            to the question above will be accessible through <ui.Code>this.prompt.someAnswer</ui.Code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            To add prompts for the user, you just need to extend the <ui.Code>prompts</ui.Code> array. A question
            for the name of the project would look like this:
        </p>

        <CodeBlock
            language="javascript"
            value={snippet2}
        />

        <p>
            For more information about user interactions check
            the <a href="https://yeoman.io/authoring/user-interactions.html" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yeoman documentation</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>writing()</h3>

        <CodeBlock
            language="javascript"
            value={snippet3}
        />

        <p>
            This is where the magic happens. This default code takes the file <ui.Code>dummyfile.txt</ui.Code> from
            the directory <ui.Code>generators/app/templates</ui.Code> and copies it to the directory from where
            the generator is called. If you want to just copy all files from the <ui.Code>templates</ui.Code> folder
            you can also use wildcard selectors:
        </p>

        <CodeBlock
            language="javascript"
            value={snippet4}
        />

        <p>
            Of course, we also want to make use of the prompts the user answered. Therefore we have to change
            the <ui.Code>this.fs.copy</ui.Code> function to <ui.Code>this.fs.copyTpl</ui.Code> and pass the
            prop to the function:
        </p>

        <CodeBlock
            language="javascript"
            value={snippet5}
        />

        <p>
            For the filesystem Yeoman is using
            the <a href="https://github.com/sboudrias/mem-fs-editor" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mem-fs-editor</a>,
            so check their documentation if you want to know more details. As templating engine Yeoman is
            using <a href="https://github.com/mde/ejs" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ejs</a>. So to make use of the
            passed variable you can include it in your files (eg. dummyfile.txt) with the following syntax:
        </p>

        <CodeBlock
            language="markup"
            value="Welcome to your project: <%= projectName %>"
        />

        <h3>install()</h3>
        <CodeBlock
            language="javascript"
            value={snippet6}
        />

        <p>
            This will run npm and bower install by default. But you can also pass parameters to specify what should be called.
        </p>

        <CodeBlock
            language="javascript"
            value={snippet7}
        />

        <p>
            It is also possible to install specific packages programmatically by
            using <ui.Code>npmInstall()</ui.Code> or <ui.Code>yarnInstall()</ui.Code>. This makes the most sense
            in combination with a check for what the user selected in the <ui.Code>prompting()</ui.Code> function:
        </p>

        <CodeBlock
            language="javascript"
            value={snippet8}
        />

        <p>
            Also, you can just remove the whole <ui.Code>install()</ui.Code> function if you don't want anything to be installed.
        </p>

        <h2>Handling user options</h2>
        <p>
            Let's have a look at how to work with user input. For that I'll add two demo options to
            the <ui.Code>prompting()</ui.Code> function:
        </p>

        <CodeBlock
            language="javascript"
            value={snippet9}
        />

        <p>
            Now we'll have <ui.Code>this.props.someAnswer</ui.Code> and <ui.Code>this.props.anotherAnswer</ui.Code> available
            in our <ui.Code>writing()</ui.Code> function.
        </p>

        <h3>Overwriting files</h3>
        <p>
            Of course, you can just copy file by file depending on the chosen options. But this is not very scalable.
            So create a new function for copying in your <ui.Code>index.js</ui.Code> file.
        </p>

        <CodeBlock
            language="javascript"
            value={snippet10}
        />

        <p>
            This is almost the same function we have in the <ui.Code>writing()</ui.Code> function. The underscore <ui.Code>_</ui.Code> indicates,
            that this is a private function. It accepts a path parameter and copies everything from the corresponding folder. So
            if we would call <ui.Code>_generateFiles('base')</ui.Code>, it would copy all files from <ui.Code>generators/app/templates/base</ui.Code>.
        </p>

        <p>
            So now let's update our <ui.Code>writing()</ui.Code> function to use <ui.Code>_generateFiles()</ui.Code>.
        </p>

        <CodeBlock
            language="javascript"
            value={snippet11}
        />

        <p>
            So this code will first copy everything from <ui.Code>templates/base</ui.Code>. Then it would copy the files <ui.Code>templates/option</ui.Code> if
            the user selected <ui.Code>someAnswer</ui.Code>. Files with the same path and title will be overwritten. Afterward, it will do the same
            for <ui.Code>anotherAnswer</ui.Code> and <ui.Code>templates/anotherOption</ui.Code>. Let's take the following example:
        </p>

        <img src="/blog/yeoman/overwriting-example.png" alt="file tree in templates directory with subfolders"/>

        <p>
            This would mean that we end up with <ui.Code>testFile.txt</ui.Code> from <ui.Code>templates/base</ui.Code> if we answered no to the
            generator's prompts. If we answer yes to the first question (<ui.Code>someAnswer</ui.Code>), we'd end up
            with <ui.Code>testFile.txt</ui.Code> and <ui.Code>textFile2.txt</ui.Code> from <ui.Code>templates/option</ui.Code>. And if we answered also yes
            to the third question (<ui.Code>anotherAnswer</ui.Code>), we'd have <ui.Code>testFile.txt</ui.Code> from <ui.Code>option</ui.Code>,
            but <ui.Code>testFile2.txt</ui.Code> and <ui.Code>testFile3.txt</ui.Code> from <ui.Code>templates/anotherOption</ui.Code>.
        </p>

        <h2>Publishing your generator to the npm registry</h2>
        <p>
            When you're done developing your generator, you can push it to the npm registry to be able to install it globally on any machine.
            If you don't want it to be available on npm you can still always use your generator by cloning your repository and
            doing <ui.Code>npm link</ui.Code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            First, you need to have an npm account. If you don't have one yet, head
            to <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/signup" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">npmjs.com/signup</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Afterward, head back to your project and type in the console
        </p>
        <CodeBlock
            value="npm login"
        />
        <p>
            Now enter the email and password of your npm account. <br/>
            The last thing you have to do is typing:
        </p>
        <CodeBlock
            value="npm publish"
        />
        <p>
            After up to one day, your generator will then also be listed on
            the <a href="https://yeoman.io/generators/" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">yeoman website</a> for others to be discovered.
        </p>
