      When I got started in web development, I never knew where to start when creating a new website.
      I was overwhelmed by possibilities as if I was looking at a blank canvas and didn't know what to draw.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over time I came up with a process that helped me not only getting started. It also helped to make
      the websites more user-friendly and better looking.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this post, I want to share this process.
    </p>

    <h2>The Preparation</h2>
    <p>
      As a first thing, I force myself to close the code editor, as I'm always tempted to
      just dive into coding right away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I start to think of the purpose of the website. Do I want to inform the visitor about something?
      Do I want them to sign up on some newsletter or is it something totally different?
    </p>
    <p>
      Now having this in mind, I'll think of what people most probably visit this site for. This can be
      things like <b>business hours</b>, <b>pricing</b>, <b>follow-up links</b>, or any other kind of <b>information</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Afterward, I write down what I want to say/show on my website. This doesn't have to be the final version of your texts.
      Normally I spend time in the end to polish copywriting.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most important part here is to bring your content into a structure that makes sense.
      Use <b>lists</b>, <b>tables</b>, <b>paragraphs</b>, <b>quotes</b> and more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now having your content structured you can get started on making it look good.
    </p>

    <h2>The Design</h2>
    <p>
      Often I already have ideas for the specific elements in my mind. But it sure helps to check
      out <a href="https://wweb.dev/resources/websites-for-inspiration" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">other websites for inspiration</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I don't look at the whole website for inspiration. Instead I look at the specific structures, I came up with when I wrote
      down the content. This way I don't force my content into some template, which doesn't really match.
      This could look like this:
    </p>

    <img
      alt="example of how a list gets transformed into a design"
      src="/blog/craft-websites-example.jpg"
    />

    <p>
      Then I take a paper and draw the structure of my site by roughly sketching the elements I have in mind
      or that I've found on my research.
    </p>
    <p>
      Afterwards, it depends on the scope of the project if I convert this drawing into a proper design by
      using design tools like Figma, Sketch, or Adobe XD. Usually, I skip this step as I mostly work on small
      projects.
    </p>

    <h2>The Coding</h2>

    <p>Then the (for me) fun part can begin: coding the website.</p>
    <p>
      First of all I decide if I want to go with a design library or want to create everything from scratch.
      This depends on the design/draft, created in the previous step.
    </p>
    <p>
      I rarely finish the whole website in one take. That's why I always leave <i>TODOs</i> and refactoring
      comments in the code or in the README, while I'm in the flow of coding.
      This helps me to get back into the project when I don't feel motivated.
      I just pick up a small refactoring and often
      end up coding more than I originally planned to.
    </p>

    <h2>Finalizing it</h2>

    <p>
      When I'm happy with the result I always verify that:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        the website is fast
        with <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lighthouse</a> or <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pagespeed Insights</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        the website is accessible with <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WAVE</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        that the website has proper SEO with <a href="https://www.seoptimer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Seoptimer</a>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <br />
    <p>
      What's your process? How does it differ? <br />
